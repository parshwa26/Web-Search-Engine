# Methodologies used

1) Web Crawler: We have used a web crawler that takes link of a particular website(static) then it gives connected links of webpages.
2) HTML to Text: We have used Jsoup which converts different HTML pages into text format.
3) Regular Expression: It is used for pattern searching for a particular word for which search is made into different stored text files.
4) Ternary Search Tree: As TST data structure  combines storage efficiency with fast lookup & we have used it for spell checking.
5) Inverted Index: It creates hash map data for a particular search we have made in the program. 
6) Quick Select Algorithm: This algorithm is used to get top webpages which has most number of word occurrences.
