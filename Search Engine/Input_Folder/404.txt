Files moved to GitHub 2019-12-30 Today all binary & source code packages were moved to GitHub Releases page, where there will no longer be any slowness of file hosting. It also makes process of releasing files much easier. 3.2.1 released! 2018-07-27 Soon after 3.2.0 few major problems appeared, which are addressed in 3.2.1. One was inability to start application under Linux, second was missing Image previewer plugin in binary packages. Both problems were caused by incorrect packaging scripts. There was also one more smaller bug regarding data exporting (see ChangeLog for more details). If you're upgrading automatically from 3.2.0, after you're done, you need to run the "UpdateSQLiteStudio" from application's folder, pick "Add or remove component" option, on next page expand the tree and mark "Image editor/viewer plugin" and proceed with installation. If you're installing/downloading 3.2.1 from homepage (and not through the auto-update), you will already have this plugin installed. 3.2.0 released! 2018-07-25 After a long time (1.5 of year), there it is! New version has new installer (based on Qt Installer Framework), therefore automatic update from 3.1.1 will not happen. Version 3.2.0 has to be downloaded manually. It comes in two flavors - portable package (as it used to be) and also with installer application. There are TONS of changes in this version (see ChangeLog for details), but most notable are: 1) BLOBs with images can be viewed/replaced directly from the app, 2) query parameters (?, :param, $param) are now supported and will ask you for values, 3) new updates mechanism from the Qt Installer Framework (the old one caused a lot of troubles to users), 4) extensions manager (define SQLite extensions to load to databases), 5) SQLite updated to recent 3.24.0 version, with support for UPSERT syntax, 6) a lot of bugfixes, but among them there are two outstanding positions: textual values, that look like numbers (i.e. 0001) are now not interpreted as number 1 anymore and CSV import plugin speed was increased by 1400 times! GitHub migration 2018-01-19 SQLiteStudio has recently migrated to GitHub. This affects the source code repository, as well as issue tracker (bugs & feature requests). This should improve colaboration with potential contributors and also make it more readable, as GitHub has well established platform for the same. All bug reports from old tracker have been migrated to GitHub. Version 3.1.1 released! 2016-11-02 Among tons of bugfixes, there are some new features, such as plugins supporting wxSQLite and System.Data.SQLite databases (latter one only under Windows), batch importing with import() (and its import_*() family) function, support for "Row Value" from recent SQLite 3.15.0 and others - see ChangeLog for full list of changes.
